                Email marketing, although being the oldest internet marketing
                medium, is still regarded as the most potent means of
                communication to create leads and secure conversions.

              <h5>What is email marketing?</h5>
              <p>
                Email marketing is basically a direct email message that is
                delivered to a specified target audience in accordance with the
                company's brand rules and standards.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you send out customized and targeted emails to your
                potential and present consumers, you are doing email marketing.
              </p>
              <h5>What is not email marketing?</h5>
              <p>
                It is necessary to grasp what email marketing is not in order to
                fully understand the notion of email marketing.
              </p>
              <p>
                A common mistake made by unskilled marketers is to consider bulk
                mailing to be equivalent to email marketing. When it comes to
                email marketing, it's not all about bombarding your customers
                with sales pitches.
              </p>
              <h5>Is email marketing dead?</h5>
              <p>These cautionary opinions are undoubtedly familiar to you:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Email is being phased out in favor of more personal
                  communication methods like Facebook and Twitter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In general, people don't want to share their information with
                  other people.
                </li>
                <li>Young people do not use email.</li>
                <li>
                  Email marketing is not as effective as other marketing
                  strategies. The age of email marketing has come to an end.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Don't believe any of the claims that have been made. Emails are
                still a favorite method of communication for many individuals,
                despite the increasing popularity of social media. Email is here
                to stay.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-primary">
                Email marketing is still alive and well, and it continues to be
                one of the most cost-effective methods of reaching consumers
                today.

              <p>
                Email is used by 90% of top business executives to communicate
                about business-related activities. In addition, 65% of B2B
                marketers say that email marketing is their most successful
                revenue-generating medium. In fact, research shows that 55% of
                customers say that marketing emails affect their purchasing
                decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sending them the correct offers and using a tone that resonates
                with them is all you need to do. The use of individualized
                subject lines is more likely to capture their attention than
                generic subject lines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Email is not a pain from the perspective of the user. Instead,
                it's a go-to platform for exchanging ideas with people and
                learning about new products and services.
              </p>
