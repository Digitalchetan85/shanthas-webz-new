                  <p>If your marketing plan fails because you are not able to understand the demographics of your target audience or are not sure where or how to find your ideal customers. If you are not able to create a steady stream of high-quality leads or boost your marketing ROI by completing more transactions on the leads that you create</p>
                  <p>Your company is in need of new ideas...</p>
                  <p>With more than 2 billion users worldwide, WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging platforms. Marketers saw the immense potential of this social networking software and began leveraging it for business.</p>
                  <p>With these two marketing services, your audience may grow and be segmented without boundaries, and your campaigns can be readily optimized for stunning results.</p>
                  <h3>WhatsApp marketing</h3>
                  <p>Whatsapp marketing is a form of message advertising that focuses on promoting a brand through the messaging service. This medium helps organizations reach a large audience, build better customer relationships, and improve revenue. It is a standalone application where your company profile will be set up when you download the app.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, you'll be able to send out mass communications to a large number of contacts, monitor responses, and plan messages in advance. Away messages and pre-programmed responses for frequently asked inquiries are both possible with WhatsApp.</p>
                  <p>Business statistics are also available on the WhatsApp for Business app. It is possible for businesses to track data such as the number of messages that have been sent, received, read, and delivered. So, businesses can better understand how their customers use WhatsApp and how they engage with it.</p>
                  <p>Businesses can use WhatsApp broadcast messages for new product updates, changes in working hours, and promotions.</p>
                  <h3>SMS marketing</h3>
                  <p>Most people know how to text from a phone, but businesses use SMS marketing in unique ways. When sending marketing texts, many companies choose to use an online SMS platform rather than a personal device.</p>
                  <p>Sending messages to possibly thousands of people at once using online platforms like these avoids the impersonal sense of sending a group text message.</p>
                  <p>You'll be able to keep track of how your messages are doing and manage responses and discussions from a single central inbox.</p>
                  <p>Consider the fact that up to 90% of SMS messages are actually viewed. When compared to other kinds of marketing, a well-executed text message marketing campaign has a relatively high open-rate.</p>
                  <h2>Use enterprise-grade messaging platforms to provide a better experience for your customers</h2>
                  <p>In today's multi-channel marketing landscape, it's impossible to avoid using SMS and WhatsApp Marketing Services. You may rest assured that your message will be seen because SMS has a 90% open rate and WhatsApp messages have a 70% open rate, which indicates that your message will be seen.</p>
                  <p>Coupon codes, marketing messages, shop locations, discounts, and offers may be easily and affordably distributed using these instant communication solutions.</p>
