                The purpose of search engine optimization (SEO) is to elevate a
                company's position in Google search results, thereby increasing
                search engine traffic to the company's website. SEO marketers
                use keyword research to determine what people are searching for
                online and include those terms in their content.
              </p>
              <p>
                Search engine optimization (SEO) is now regarded as an essential
                part of any successful marketing strategy. Digital marketing is
                incomplete without SEO. To put it simply, it's all about using
                the internet as a vehicle for bringing in new clients and
                increasing sales.
              </p>
              <p>
                A well optimized website will appear on the first page of the
                search engine results page (SERP). Furthermore, it is widely
                believed that individuals browse and check the first two pages
                of the search engine results page (SERP). A large number of
                people use search engines to find information about local
                businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the help of other marketing channels, the search may be a
                key driver of website traffic for many companies today. Gaining
                an advantage over your competitors by being more visible and
                ranking higher in search results may have a significant
                influence on your companyâ€™s financial success.
              </p>
              <p>
                SEO offers a strong return on investment when compared to other
                forms of online marketing, such as pay-per-click (PPC), social
                media marketing (SMM), and email marketing. Customers check
                internet reviews virtually every day before making a final
                decision on which things to purchase.

                good SEO:
              </p>

                <li>

              <p>Rank your website higher in Google with the help of ShanthasWebz. We will perform an SEO check and improve your visibility.</p>
              <p>There are three main pillars of SEO that you should be familiar with and use on a daily basis:</p>
              <h6>Technical Optimization:</h6>  
              <p>Technical optimization is the process of performing tasks on your site that are intended to boost SEO but are not directly linked to content, such as site speed optimization. It is common for this to take place in the background.</p>
              <h6>On-Page Optimization:</h6>
              <p>On-Page Optimization is the process of ensuring that the information on your website is relevant and offers a fantastic user experience. A content management system (CMS) may be used to help you target the correct keywords in your content. WordPress, Wix, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, Shopify, and Expression Engine are some of the most popular content management systems on the market today.</p>
              <h6>Off-Page Optimization:</h6>
              <p>By engaging in actions outside of your site itself, off-page optimization works to improve your site's position in search engine results. Backlinks are a major contributor to off-page optimization since they aid in the development of the site's authority.</p>
              <h3 className="text-primary pt-2 pb-2">Setting goals for SEO for different kinds of Businesses</h3>
              <p>Your goals will be different based on whether your company is transactional or informative.</p>
              <p>You'll want to define your targets around tracking sales and lead conversions if your firm is transactional and includes an e-commerce component to them. If you're running a non-eCommerce business website, on the other hand, you'll want to concentrate on lead generation.</p>
              <p>If your company is in the information business, you are more likely to create goals that are focused on increasing brand awareness or increasing website traffic.</p>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>All things considered, SEO is the cornerstone of a well-rounded digital marketing strategy. Understanding what your website visitors desire allows you to use that knowledge in your paid and organic marketing strategies, as well as in the design and development of your website and social media assets.</p>
