                eCommerce websites are more than just a place to find
                information. They are also a place to buy things. The purpose of
                e-commerce websites is to allow consumers to submit their
                billing and shipping addresses, as well as their chosen payment
                methods, in a more hands-on manner to expedite commercial
                transactions that involve data transfer online
              </p>
              <p>
                The convenience of purchasing items and services from the
                comfort of one's own home and expecting delivery in a short
                period of time is made possible through this platform. Amazon,
                Flipkart, Myntra, and so on are some of the most popular
                e-commerce sites.

              <h4>How We Work as an eCommerce Web Design Company</h4>
              <p>
                When it comes to eCommerce web design and development, we at
                eScale normally follow a certain procedure. In a nutshell, here
                is how it works:
              </p>
              <h5>Initial professional consultation:</h5>
              <p>Initially, we meet with a potential client to find out
              exactly what they are looking for and whether or not we are a
              suitable fit for each other (on both sides). As you can see, we
              don't work with just anyone. We only partner with companies that
              have a purposeful, positive influence or are making a difference
              in some way.</p>
              <h5>A blueprint should be drawn up:</h5>
              <p>A nice fit is found, and our new customer sends us a list of websites they enjoy and want to use as inspiration for their new eCommerce business. Now that we have this information, we can start creating a blueprint for the website's appearance, feel, and organization.</p>
              <h5>Make a prototype of your project:</h5>
              <p>The next step is to create a wireframe, which is a visual representation of the website's structure and the content that will appear there.</p>
              <h5>The process of conceptualizing and creating:</h5>
              <p>Finally, there is the design and construction of an e-commerce website. Not only do we design for the desktop, but we also design for mobile phones. That way, your visitors won't need their reading glasses because your website's material is easy to read!</p>
              <p>In addition, what you see in the design is what you receive in the final product. With many agencies, the final product is frequently of lower quality than the original design... but not with us.</p>
              <h5>Keep testing, testing, testing:</h5>
              <p>In order to verify that a website is ready to go live, we do comprehensive testing and quality assurance. Yes, you might categorize us as perfectionists...</p>

              <h3 className="text-primary">Your online success depends on us</h3>
              <p>The e-commerce industry is one of the most fiercely competitive in the world today. A professional agency is essential if you want to make your website stand out from the crowd.</p>
              <p>Your ecommerce website requires the expertise of a firm that understands how to design category and product pages as well as landing pages, contest entries, form fields, contact pages, and all of the other necessary components of an ecommerce website.</p>
              <p>You can be certain that you will lose important traffic and clients to your competition if you do not have one.</p>
